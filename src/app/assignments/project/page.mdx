## Deliverables

### Introduction and Idea

Prepare and present 2 slides, in the provided presentation shared by the entire class:
- 1 slide introducing yourself to the class.
- 1 slide introducing an idea for a project direction.

Presentation will be limited to 2 minutes.

**Slides Due:** Wed Apr 2, 8pm

**Presentation:** In-Class, Thu Apr 3

&nbsp;

### Group Brainstorm

As a potential group, brainstorm 3 possible project directions, in the provided document shared by the entire class:
- Must be submitted with a group, as represented in the provided signup document.
- Group membership may also continue to evolve after this assignment.
- Each idea must not exceed 100 words.
- Images may be included and do not count against the word limit.
- Possible project directions may draw inspiration from anything.
  They must also credit any major inspiration.

Submit via Canvas.

All members of a project group should submit the PDF
(i.e., because this is easiest for course staff while groups are still potentially in flux).

**Due:** Wed Apr 9, 8pm

&nbsp;

### Groups Finalized

Finalize a project group in the provided signup document shared by the entire class.

**Due:** Sun Apr 13, 8pm

&nbsp;

### Design Proposal

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Submit a design proposal that does not exceed 800 words.
- Create a subfolder in your group's Google Drive folder called "Proposal" for all documentation.
- Include sketches, mockups, or other visual elements to illustrate your design.
- Images do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Identify the portion of your design that is directly related to Human-AI Interaction. Define the vertical boundary of your project.
  - This must not exceed 200 words.
- Describe 3 main task scenarios showing interactions enabled in part by AI, with sketches or mockups illustrating the task walkthrough.
  - Each must not exceed 200 words.
- Document your exploration of the underlying AI techniques in a readable format (e.g., a separate Google doc, PDF, or python notebook).
  - Keep them in the same Proposal folder.
  - Link to them in the proposal doc.
  - You can consider including:
    - Example prompts you plan to use
    - Expected input/output formats
    - Any prototype notebooks or exploratory code


Submit via Canvas.

**Due:** Mon Apr 21, 8pm

### Formative Research

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Submit a Formative Research report that does not exceed 1200 words.
- Author this assignment in the Drive folder corresponding to your project group.
- Create a subfolder called "Formative Research", keep all documents in this folder.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images to illustrate your updated design.
- Images and updated Design Proposal do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Formative research with 2 participants
  - Each must not exceed 250 words.
  - We generally expect this will be interviews around your design proposal, but you can choose a suitable research method.
  - Describe the formative research method used with your participants.
  - Summarize key findings from each session.
  - Include specific evidence from your research to support your findings.
- Formative research with an AI
  - This must not exceed 250 words.
  - Describe your process for using an AI to gain insights into your design problem or proposed solution, referencing the approach outlined in the paper ["Simulating the Human in HCD with ChatGPT"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3637436).
  - Determine if the AI's responses were useful in addition to your formative research with participants.
    If useful, detail the specific prompts you used and explain your prompting strategy.
    If not useful, describe what you tried, why you feel the AI fell short from being useful.
  - Include specific evidence from your AI research.
- Updated Design Proposal
  - Describe the main changes made to your design based on your research findings.
      This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Clearly state which findings led to each significant change.
  - Present updated versions of your 3 primary task scenarios:
    - Highlight revisions made since the initial Design Proposal.
    - Provide a rationale for each revision.
    - Update the corresponding description of the offline exploration of AI need.
- Planned technology stack and rationale
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Describe the specific technologies you plan to use to implement your design.
  - Provide a rationale for choosing this stack.
      You may briefly mention any alternatives you considered.
- Reflect on one specific thing you learned during the formative research process.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Explain how this learning influenced the evolution of your design.
