  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your formative research relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a specific finding and how it motivated changes or validated your design.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design,
    then considering your findings and changes relative to the principle.
    Consider how the finding shaped new understanding of the principle,
    how your changes align with or were informed by the principle,
    or how the principle highlights a challenge or design tension around the finding.

### Poster

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Create a poster that communicates your design and related findings, insights, or learnings.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects. Your poster should include:
- Project Title
- Your Names
- Design Motivation and Approach
  - The need, opportunity, or problem explored in your design.
  - The overall concept of your design and your focus within that concept.
- Key Human-AI Interaction Functionality
  - This likely corresponds to your three task scenarios.
- Key Findings, Insights, or Learnings
  - Include 3 key findings, insights, or learnings.
  - At least 1 should relate to your interface design.
  - At least 1 should relate to the underlying use of a language model.

For consistency in printing and display, your poster must be 32" x 40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).

The staff have assembled several templates you can use as a starting point:
- <a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateA}>Powerpoint Template A</a>
- <a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateB}>Powerpoint Template B</a>
- <a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateC}>Powerpoint Template C</a>

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project:

- Posters are intended to support a conversation about your project.
- Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
- Be sure images are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
- Modify the template colors to ensure your poster is unique.

As you plan content for your poster,
be mindful that you will also have a demo and a video available during the final poster showcase.

Submit via Canvas.
Due to frequent challenges in printing, submit both:
- A PDF of your poster.
- The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file).

We then expect teams to be available and responsive via email for feedback and rapid iteration to finalize the poster.

**Due:** Fri May 30, 8pm

&nbsp;

  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle,
    then reflect on your interactive prototype and usability testing relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a specific insight and how it motivates changes or validates your design.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design,
    then considering your insights and changes relative to the principle.
    Consider how the insight shaped new understanding of the principle,
    how your changes align with or were informed by the principle,
    or how the principle highlights a challenge or design tension around the insight.

Submit a Design Status Report as a separate document.
- Follow guidance in <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.assignmentsProjectDesignStatusReports}/>.
