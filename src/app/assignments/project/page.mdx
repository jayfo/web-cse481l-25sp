### Design Proposal

Submit a design proposal that does not exceed 1000 words.
- Author this assignment in the Drive folder corresponding to your project group.
- Create a subfolder called "Design Proposal", keep all documents in this folder.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images where helpful to illustrate your design.
- Images do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Describe the overall concept of your design.
  - This must not exceed 100 words.
  - An overall design concept might be more than you can implement in this course.
- Describe the elements of your design within which you will focus your exploration of human-AI interaction.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Vertical prototyping emphasizes deep exploration of a portion of an overall design.
    Describe what you intend to deeply design and implement.
    Ensure this portion of your design emphasizes human-AI interaction.
  - Briefly describe any key aspects of your overall design concept that you will not aim to design and implement.
    Describe how you anticipate your design process mocking or working around these omissions.
- Illustrate 3 primary task scenarios.
  Recall a scenario demonstrates how a task is accomplished with a design.
  - Each scenario must not exceed 200 words.
  - In one sentence, describe the task (i.e., what is accomplished).
  - Use images to illustrate the scenario via a walkthrough of each key step in accomplishing the task with your design.
    These can be sketches, mockups, or other illustrations of how a person will experience the scenario.
  - Convey the walkthrough in enough detail that course staff can understand step-by-step interaction with your design.
    We expect each scenario will include multiple images, but do not expect more than 6 images in a scenario.
    In the next formative research assignment,
    you will use these scenarios as part of describing your design and seeking feedback from formative research participants.
  - Any text used in the walkthrough does not count against the word limit.
  - Describe your initial exploration of language model support needed in the proposed interaction.
    Consider when and how your design will invoke the language model throughout the scenario.
    Consider the expected input and output for these language model invocations.
    Consider exploring specific prompts,
    such as by using conversational AI tools or Python notebooks to probe the capabilities needed in your scenario.
  - Summarize key activities and learnings in your initial exploration of language model support.
    If understanding those requires additional supporting documentation,
    provide that in the same folder in a human-readable format (e.g., another document, PDFs).
    Appropriately reference this supporting documentation in your description.
    We do not intend this to be a burden,
    so you may decide whether you feel such documentation is necessary for engaging with course staff around your design.
- Reflect upon your design proposal relative to a principle of human-AI interaction
  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your design proposal relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a goal for formative research relative to the principle.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design proposal,
    then reflecting on the need to more thoroughly explore these elements of your design relative to the principle.
    Consider what decisions you might aim to make, what you might aim to learn,
    or how your design might evolve in response to formative research.

Submit via Canvas.

**Due:** Mon Apr 21, 8pm

### Formative Research

Submit formative research that does not exceed 1200 words.
- Author this assignment in the Drive folder corresponding to your project group.
- Create a subfolder called "Formative Research", keep all documents in this folder.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images where helpful to illustrate your research.
- Images do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Report on formative research with 2 participants.
  - Each must not exceed 250 words.
  - We generally expect groups will choose to conduct interviews around their design proposal
    (e.g., seeking feedback on the overall concept and on details of specific scenarios).
    However, you can choose a research method that is appropriate for your goals.
  - Describe the formative research method used with each participant
    (e.g., what you aimed to learn,
    key details of how you applied your method,
    who the participant was and why you recruited them).
  - Summarize the most important findings from the session.
    These will be actionable opportunities or insights that changed or refined your thinking about your design.
  - Include specific evidence from your research to support your findings.
    We generally expect this will be quotes or other specific feedback from the participant.
- Report on formative research with an AI.
  - This must not exceed 250 words.
  - Because language models can encode human experiences,
    it has been proposed that they can support design research.
    For example, see [Simulating the Human in HCD with ChatGPT: Redesigning Interaction Design with AI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3637436).
  - Describe an exploration of trying to use an AI to gain insights into your design problem or proposed solution.
    For example, describe what types of insights you hoped AI might provide,
    how you explored its ability to provide those insights,
    and how you iterated in your prompting throughout that exploration.
  - If your exploration proves useful, detail the insights that you surfaced.
    These will be actionable opportunities or insights that changed or refined your thinking about your design.
  - If your exploration does not prove useful, detail why you feel AI responses were not helpful.
    Describe what you tried in your exploration of whether you could obtain more helpful AI responses.
  - Include specific evidence from your exploration to support your findings.
    We generally expect this will be excerpts of specific prompts or responses that illustrate your findings.
- Summarize changes to your design based on your formative research findings.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Describe how your findings prompted you to changes aspects of your design,
    being sure to describe the relationship between findings and the resulting changes
  - If your findings have not motivated changes,
    instead describe how findings validate specific aspects of your existing design.
  - Note you will separately provide updated task scenarios.
- Describe your planned technology stack.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Describe a specific combination of technologies you plan to use to implement your design.
  - Provide a rationale for choosing this technology stack.
    For example, note alternatives you considered and why you prefer your chosen combination.
- Reflect upon your formative research relative to a principle of human-AI interaction
  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your formative research relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a specific finding and how it motivated changes or validated your design.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design,
    then considering your findings and changes relative to the principle.
    Consider how the finding shaped new understanding of the principle,
    how your changes align with or were informed by the principle,
    or how the principle highlights a challenge or design tension around the finding.

Submit your current design in a separate document that does not exceed 700 words.
- Author this in the same Drive folder.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images where helpful to illustrate your design.

Include the following sections:
- Summarize your current design.
  Include a brief description of its overall concept
  and where you are focusing your exploration of human-AI interaction within that overall concept.
  - This must not exceed 100 words.
  - Each project assignment will include this summary.
    You may simply copy it forward between assignments,
    but should ensure it remains current as your design and your approach evolve in the project.

  - Use images to illustrate the scenario via a walkthrough of each key step in accomplishing the task with your design.
    These can be sketches, mockups, or other illustrations of how a person will experience the scenario.
    As you develop more of your project, these should become screenshots showing interaction with your design.
  - Convey the walkthrough in enough detail that course staff can understand step-by-step interaction with your design.
    We expect each scenario will include multiple images, but do not expect more than 6 images in a scenario.
  - Any text used in the walkthrough does not count against the word limit.
  - After the walkthrough, highlight key specific changes or details of your design
    that are most important for understanding your design.
