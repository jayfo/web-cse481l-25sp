- Include images where helpful to illustrate your design.
- Images do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Describe the overall concept of your design.
  - This must not exceed 100 words.
  - An overall design concept might be more than you can implement in this course.
- Describe the elements of your design within which you will focus your exploration of human-AI interaction.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Vertical prototyping emphasizes deep exploration of a portion of an overall design.
    Describe what you intend to deeply design and implement.
    Ensure this portion of your design emphasizes human-AI interaction.
  - Briefly describe any key aspects of your overall design concept that you will not aim to design and implement.
    Describe how you anticipate your design process mocking or working around these omissions.
- Illustrate 3 primary task scenarios.
  Recall a scenario demonstrates how a task is accomplished with a design.
  - Each scenario must not exceed 200 words.
  - In one sentence, describe the task (i.e., what is accomplished).
  - Use images to illustrate the scenario via a walkthrough of each key step in accomplishing the task with your design.
    These can be sketches, mockups, or other illustrations of how a person will experience the scenario.
  - Convey the walkthrough in enough detail that course staff can understand step-by-step interaction with your design.
    We expect each scenario will include multiple images, but do not expect more than 6 images in a scenario.
    In the next formative research assignment,
    you will use these scenarios as part of describing your design and seeking feedback from formative research participants.
  - Any text used in the walkthrough does not count against the word limit.
  - Describe your initial exploration of language model support needed in the proposed interaction.
    Consider when and how your design will invoke the language model throughout the scenario.
    Consider the expected input and output for these language model invocations.
    Consider exploring specific prompts,
    such as by using conversational AI tools or Python notebooks to probe the capabilities needed in your scenario.
  - Summarize key activities and learnings in your initial exploration of language model support.
    If understanding those requires additional supporting documentation,
    provide that in the same folder in a human-readable format (e.g., another document, PDFs).
    Appropriately reference this supporting documentation in your description.
    We do not intend this to be a burden,
    so you may decide whether you feel such documentation is necessary for engaging with course staff around your design.
- Reflect upon your design proposal relative to a principle of human-AI interaction
  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your design proposal relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a goal for formative research relative to the principle.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design proposal,
    then reflecting on the need to more thoroughly explore these elements of your design relative to the principle.
    Consider what decisions you might aim to make, what you might aim to learn,
    or how your design might evolve in response to formative research.

  - Include specific evidence from your research to support your findings.
    We generally expect this will be quotes or other specific feedback from the participant.
- Report on formative research with an AI.
  - This must not exceed 250 words.
  - Because language models can encode human experiences,
    it has been proposed that they can support design research.
    For example, see [Simulating the Human in HCD with ChatGPT: Redesigning Interaction Design with AI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3637436).
  - Describe an exploration of trying to use an AI to gain insights into your design problem or proposed solution.
    For example, describe what types of insights you hoped AI might provide,
    how you explored its ability to provide those insights,
    and how you iterated in your prompting throughout that exploration.
  - If your exploration proves useful, detail the insights that you surfaced.
    These will be actionable opportunities or insights that changed or refined your thinking about your design.
  - If your exploration does not prove useful, detail why you feel AI responses were not helpful.

  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your formative research relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a specific finding and how it motivated changes or validated your design.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design,
    then considering your findings and changes relative to the principle.
    Consider how the finding shaped new understanding of the principle,
    how your changes align with or were informed by the principle,
    or how the principle highlights a challenge or design tension around the finding.
