## Deliverables

### Introduction and Idea

Prepare and present 2 slides, in the provided presentation shared by the entire class:
- 1 slide introducing yourself to the class.
- 1 slide introducing an idea for a project direction.

Presentation will be limited to 2 minutes.

**Slides Due:** Wed Apr 2, 8pm

**Presentation:** In-Class, Thu Apr 3

&nbsp;

### Group Brainstorm

As a potential group, brainstorm 3 possible project directions, in the provided document shared by the entire class:
- Must be submitted with a group, as represented in the provided signup document.
- Group membership may also continue to evolve after this assignment.
- Each idea must not exceed 100 words.
- Images may be included and do not count against the word limit.
- Possible project directions may draw inspiration from anything.
  They must also credit any major inspiration.

Submit via Canvas.

All members of a project group should submit the PDF
(i.e., because this is easiest for course staff while groups are still potentially in flux).

**Due:** Wed Apr 9, 8pm

&nbsp;

### Groups Finalized

Finalize a project group in the provided signup document shared by the entire class.

**Due:** Sun Apr 13, 8pm

&nbsp;

### Design Proposal

Submit a design proposal that does not exceed 1000 words.
- Author this assignment in the Drive folder corresponding to your project group.
- Create a subfolder called "Design Proposal", keep all documents in this folder.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images to illustrate your design.
- Images do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Describe the overall concept of your design.
  - This must not exceed 100 words.
  - An overall design concept might be more than you can implement in this course.
- Describe the elements of your design within which you will focus your exploration of human-AI interaction.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Vertical prototyping emphasizes deep exploration of a portion of an overall design.
    Describe what you intend to deeply design and implement.
    Ensure this portion of your design emphasizes human-AI interaction.
  - Briefly describe any key aspects of your overall design concept that you will not aim to design and implement.
    Describe how you anticipate your design process mocking or working around these omissions.
- Illustrate 3 primary task scenarios.
  Recall a scenario demonstrates how a task is accomplished with a design.
  - Each scenario must not exceed 200 words.
  - In one sentence, describe the task (i.e., what is accomplished).
  - Use images to illustrate the scenario via a walkthrough of each key step in accomplishing the task with your design.
    These can be sketches, mockups, or other illustrations of how a person will experience the scenario.
  - Convey the walkthrough in enough detail that course staff can understand step-by-step interaction with your design.
    In the next formative research assignment,
    you will use these scenarios as part of describing your design and seeking feedback from formative research participants.
    We expect each scenario will include multiple images, but do not expect more than 6 images in a scenario.
  - Describe your initial exploration of language model support needed in the proposed interaction.
    Consider when and how your design will invoke the language model throughout the scenario.
    Consider the expected input and output for these language model invocations.
    Consider exploring specific prompts,
    such as by using conversational AI tools or Python notebooks to probe the capabilities needed in your scenario.
  - Do not include full experimentation data in the proposal itself, but instead summarize key activities and learnings.
    Provide supporting documentation in human-readable formats (e.g., another document, PDFs) in the folder with your proposal.
    Appropriately reference this supporting documentation from your design proposal.
- Reflect upon your design proposal relative to a principle of human-AI interaction
  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your design proposal relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a goal for formative research relative to the principle.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design proposal,
    then reflecting on the need to more thoroughly explore these elements of your design relative to the principle.
    Consider what decisions you might aim to make, what you might aim to learn,
    or how your design might evolve in response to formative research.

Submit via Canvas.

**Due:** Mon Apr 21, 8pm

### Formative Research

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Submit a Formative Research report that does not exceed 1200 words.
- Author this assignment in the Drive folder corresponding to your project group.
- Create a subfolder called "Formative Research", keep all documents in this folder.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images to illustrate your updated design.
- Images and updated Design Proposal do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Formative research with 2 participants
  - Each must not exceed 250 words.
  - We generally expect this will be interviews around your design proposal, but you can choose a suitable research method.
  - Describe the formative research method used with your participants.
  - Summarize key findings from each session.
  - Include specific evidence from your research to support your findings.
- Formative research with an AI
  - This must not exceed 250 words.
  - Describe your process for using an AI to gain insights into your design problem or proposed solution, referencing the approach outlined in the paper ["Simulating the Human in HCD with ChatGPT"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3637436).
  - Determine if the AI's responses were useful in addition to your formative research with participants.
    If useful, detail the specific prompts you used and explain your prompting strategy.
    If not useful, describe what you tried, why you feel the AI fell short from being useful.
  - Include specific evidence from your AI research.
- Updated Design Proposal
  - Describe the main changes made to your design based on your research findings.
      This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Clearly state which findings led to each significant change.
  - Present updated versions of your 3 primary task scenarios:
    - Highlight revisions made since the initial Design Proposal.
    - Provide a rationale for each revision.
    - Update the corresponding description of the offline exploration of AI need.
- Planned technology stack and rationale
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Describe the specific technologies you plan to use to implement your design.
  - Provide a rationale for choosing this stack.
      You may briefly mention any alternatives you considered.
- Reflect on one specific thing you learned during the formative research process.
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Explain how this learning influenced the evolution of your design.
