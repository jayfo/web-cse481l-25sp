# Configure Git to handle line endings across operating systems.
#
# '* text=auto' tells Git to:
#   1. Automatically detect whether files are text or binary.
#   2. For text files, convert line endings to LF when adding files to the repository.
#   3. When checking out files on Windows, convert line endings to CRLF.
#
# This helps:
#   - Ensure consistent line endings in the repository regardless of contributor operating systems.
#   - Prevent unnecessary line ending changes in diffs when collaborating across platforms.
#   - Avoid "false" changes that only involve line ending differences.
